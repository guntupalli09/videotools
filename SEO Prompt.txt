You are a principal SEO engineer + growth architect working inside this codebase. 
Your mission is to implement best-in-class, future-proof SEO that drives organic traffic fast and compounds long-term — without breaking any existing functionality, workflows, UI/UX, or performance.

You must work systematically, in phases, with verification after each phase.

ABSOLUTE CONSTRAINTS:
- Do NOT break upload, processing, auth, payments, APIs, or routing.
- Do NOT degrade UI/UX or clutter interfaces.
- Do NOT introduce thin/spammy content.
- All SEO changes must be incremental and reversible.
- Follow best practices for the current framework (SSR/SSG preferred for SEO pages).
- Provide clear diffs + verification steps after each phase.

=====================================================
PHASE 1 — LIVE MARKET & KEYWORD INTELLIGENCE (REQUIRED)
=====================================================

Use live online search and reputable SEO data sources to identify real, in-demand, trending keywords for this product’s niche:

Niche focus:
- video to text
- transcription tools
- subtitle generators
- youtube transcript download
- podcast to text
- multilingual subtitles
- file format conversions (mp4 to srt, vtt, etc)
- creator workflow automation

Sources to consult:
- Google Trends
- SERP autocomplete & People Also Ask
- Reddit search trends (creator & productivity subs)
- YouTube search suggestions
- SEO industry trend reports (Ahrefs/SEMrush blogs if accessible)
- Competitor SEO gap analysis

Build a table:

Keyword | Estimated Demand | Trend (rising/stable/declining) | Search Intent | Competition Level | Recommended Page Type

Prioritize keywords with:
✔ high intent
✔ rising or stable demand
✔ realistic competition

=====================================================
PHASE 2 — SEO ARCHITECTURE & CONTENT SYSTEM
=====================================================

From the keyword research:

1) Design a scalable SEO site structure including:
   - Core product pages
   - Programmatic landing pages
   - Authority content clusters
   - Internal linking hierarchy

2) For each high-priority keyword create:
   - URL slug
   - SEO title
   - meta description
   - H1
   - content outline (sections)
   - FAQ questions
   - structured data types to use

Ensure pages are:
- genuinely helpful
- not keyword-stuffed
- designed for conversion

=====================================================
PHASE 3 — TECHNICAL SEO (IMPLEMENT FIRST)
=====================================================

Audit and fix:

- robots.txt
- sitemap.xml (dynamic if possible)
- canonical URLs
- https & domain normalization
- redirect duplicates
- indexability issues
- 404/410 handling
- Core Web Vitals quick wins
- SSR/SSG SEO rendering where applicable

=====================================================
PHASE 4 — ON-PAGE SEO + SCHEMA
=====================================================

Implement:

- optimized titles & meta for all public pages
- OpenGraph/Twitter tags
- JSON-LD structured data:
  - Organization
  - SoftwareApplication
  - WebSite SearchAction (if applicable)
  - BreadcrumbList
  - FAQPage where relevant

Ensure clean heading hierarchy and semantic HTML.

=====================================================
PHASE 5 — PROGRAMMATIC SEO PAGES (SAFE SCALE ONLY)
=====================================================

Create initial batch (10–20 pages max) of high-intent pages using config-driven generation.

Each page must include:
- strong above-the-fold value proposition
- CTA wired into existing flow
- useful real content (not filler)
- internal links
- FAQ + schema
- canonical tags
- sitemap inclusion

=====================================================
PHASE 6 — INTERNAL LINKING & NAV BOOST
=====================================================

Add:
- related tools modules (lightweight)
- breadcrumbs
- contextual links inside content

Goal: money pages within 2–3 clicks of homepage.

=====================================================
PHASE 7 — MEASUREMENT & FAST INDEXING
=====================================================

Provide:

- checklist to verify crawl/index health
- instructions to submit sitemap
- URLs to request indexing
- KPIs to watch for week-1 uplift:
  impressions
  CTR
  indexed pages

=====================================================
DELIVERABLES
=====================================================

After completion provide:

1) Keyword intelligence table
2) SEO architecture diagram (text is fine)
3) List of pages created/optimized
4) Git diff/patches grouped by phase
5) Verification checklist
6) Expected short-term vs long-term impact

=====================================================
START NOW:
Run Phase 1 keyword research first.
Do not change any code until the keyword strategy is produced and approved.
Proceed step by step.
