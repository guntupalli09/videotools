# Production Setup

This project (VideoText) is a **production** deployment, not a dev or demo environment.

When making changes or giving advice:

- **Persistence**: Assume users, auth, and usage must survive restarts and scale (e.g. database or durable store).
- **Security**: No hardcoded secrets, proper env for keys, safe handling of tokens and passwords.
- **Operations**: Config, logging, and errors should be suitable for production (no dev shortcuts).
- **Recommendations**: Prefer production-ready solutions (e.g. recommend a database for login/user data when relevant).
