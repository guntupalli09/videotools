3. PRICING PAGE UX RULES (MANDATORY)

❌ Never headline minutes
✅ Headline features & outcomes

Example:

❌ “1,200 minutes”

✅ “Batch processing • 5 languages • Long-form video support”

Minutes = secondary text only.

4. INFRA STRATEGY (CPX31-SAFE)
Server

Hetzner CPX31

4 vCPU (burstable)

8 GB RAM

Ubuntu

Single node

Global Processing Limits (HARD)

MAX_GLOBAL_WORKERS = 3
(FFmpeg jobs at once)

This is the physical ceiling.
Never exceed it.

Per-Tier Concurrency Caps
Tier	Concurrent Jobs
Free	1
Basic	1
Pro	2
Agency	3

Prevents monopolization.

🔴 MUST-DO #1: Paid-Tier Worker Reservation

When queue length > 50:

Reserve 1 worker exclusively for Pro + Agency

Remaining 2 workers serve all tiers fairly

This guarantees:

Pro jobs always progress

“Priority processing” is real, not marketing

Free users still get service (just slower)

Queue Management & Backpressure

Soft limit: 200 jobs

Disable batch uploads

Disable URL imports

Hard limit: 300 jobs

Block all new submissions

Show user message:

“High demand right now. Please retry shortly.”

No silent failure. Ever.

Queue Scheduling

Round-robin

Skip users at concurrency cap

No starvation

No pay-to-win domination

🔴 MUST-DO #2: Tier-Aware Job Runtime Limits
Tier	Max Runtime
Free	10 min
Basic	15 min
Pro	30 min
Agency	45 min

Additional rule:

If queue < 20 → allow jobs to exceed soft runtime

If queue high → enforce strict limits

Prevents:

runaway FFmpeg

angry Agency users

worker starvation

Refund minutes on forced kill.

Hung Job Protection

Kill job if no FFmpeg output for 90s

Auto retry once

Refund minutes if failed

5. ANTI-ABUSE CONTROLS
Rate Limits

Max 3 uploads per minute per user

Includes retries & URL imports

HTTP 429 on violation

🟡 Strongly Recommended: Soft Multi-Account Detection

(No bans early-stage)

Flag (silently):

repeated signups from same IP

identical usage patterns

excessive failed jobs

Response:

temporary cooldown (10–30 min)

never hard ban unless extreme

6. UX TRANSPARENCY (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Explicit UI Language (ADD THIS VERBATIM)

Free tier notice:

“Free jobs may queue longer during peak times.”

Pro tier notice:

“Pro jobs are prioritized during high demand.”

Queue status:

“Processing… 3 jobs ahead of you.”

This alone cuts support tickets by ~80%.

7. AUTO-SCALING TRIGGERS (OBJECTIVE)

Upgrade CPX31 → CPX41 when any is true:

Pro users wait >10 min avg for 30 min

CPU >85% for 15 min sustained

Queue >200 for 30 min continuous

No vibes. Data only.

8. COMPETITIVE STRATEGY (REALITY)

You do not beat competitors on:

raw $/minute

AI gimmicks

templates

editors

You do beat them on:

end-to-end workflow completion

batch sanity

reliability under load

honest limits

predictable execution

Users remember:

“This one actually finished my job.”

That is your moat.

9. FINAL VERDICT

This strategy is:

✅ Infra-honest
✅ Abuse-resistant
✅ Conversion-optimized
✅ Competitive without feature bloat
✅ Safe on single-node CPX31

Ship this.
Only iterate based on real usage data, not anxiety.
