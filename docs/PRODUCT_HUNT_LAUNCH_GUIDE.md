# Product Hunt Launch Guide: VideoText

A step-by-step guide to fill out the Product Hunt form and run a strong launch day.

---

## 1. Form copy (fill this in)

### Name of the launch
**VideoText** ✓ (already set, 9/40 — good)

### Tagline (max 60 characters)
Pick one or adapt:

- **Option A (benefit-focused):**  
  `AI video transcription & subtitles. Paste URL or upload. No signup. We don't store your data.`
- **Option B (shorter):**  
  `Transcribe video to text, generate SRT/VTT, translate & burn captions. Free tier, no signup.`
- **Option C (privacy hook):**  
  `Video to text & subtitles in one place. Process and go — we don’t keep your files.`

Use the one that fits the 60-character limit and feels most like your voice.

### Links
- **Primary:** `https://videotext.io/` ✓  
- **Add more links** (optional but helpful):  
  - Direct tool: e.g. `https://videotext.io/video-to-transcript` or `/video-to-subtitles`  
  - If you have a Twitter/X, LinkedIn, or YouTube demo, add them so people can follow or see a quick demo.

### Is this an open source project?
Leave **unchecked** unless the repo is public and you want to position it as open source.

### X (Twitter) account of the launch
Replace the placeholder with your real handle, e.g. `x.com/YourHandle` or `https://twitter.com/YourHandle`.  
Use the account you’ll use to post about the launch and reply to comments.

### Description of the launch (max 500 characters)
You have 175/500 used. You can expand with differentiators and a clear CTA. Example:

**Suggested description (under 500 chars):**

> VideoText is an AI-powered suite for video-to-text and subtitles: transcribe with optional summary, chapters, and speaker diarization; generate SRT/VTT and translate them; fix timing and grammar; burn captions into video; compress files; and run batch jobs. Paste a URL or upload — no signup required on the free tier. We process your files and don’t store them; privacy is built in. Built for creators, educators, and teams who need fast, reliable captions and transcripts.

Tweak to match your tone; keep the “we don’t store your data” line — it’s a strong differentiator.

### Launch tags (select up to 3)
Choose tags that match how people will find you. Suggested:

1. **Artificial Intelligence** (core to the product)  
2. **Productivity** or **Developer Tools** (depending on whether you target creators vs devs)  
3. **Media** or **Accessibility** (subtitles/captions angle)

Search Product Hunt’s tag list and pick the 3 that best fit.

### Write the first comment
This comment is critical — it kicks off the discussion. Product Hunt suggests: what inspired you, what problem you solved, how your approach evolved.

**Template (customize with your real story):**

> We built VideoText because we were tired of juggling multiple tools for transcription, subtitles, and caption workflows. We wanted one place where you could paste a link or upload a file, get accurate AI-powered transcripts and SRT/VTT, translate and fix subtitles, burn captions into video, and even compress files — without creating an account to try it.
>
> A core decision from day one was to not store user data. Files are processed and then deleted. That’s reflected in our privacy policy and in how we talk about the product, because we think creators and teams deserve that clarity.
>
> We’d love to hear how you use video in your work and what you’d want next from a tool like this.

Replace “we” with “I” if you’re solo, and add one concrete moment (e.g. “After struggling with X, we decided to…”).

## 2. Pre-launch checklist

- [ ] **Hunter:** If someone else is “hunting” you (posting the product), align with them on launch date and time. If you’re self-hunting, that’s fine — just be ready to be active all day.
- [ ] **Launch day:** Tuesday–Thursday often perform best. Pick one date and stick to it.
- [ ] **Time:** Launch at **12:01 AM PT** so you have a full 24 hours on the front page in the US.
- [ ] **Landing page:** Ensure [videotext.io](https://videotext.io) loads fast, has a clear value prop, and a visible CTA (e.g. “Try free” or “Get started”).
- [ ] **Free tier:** Confirm the free tier works without signup so visitors can try immediately.
- [ ] **Twitter/X:** Schedule a launch tweet for the morning of launch (PT). Pin it.
- [ ] **Email / community:** If you have a small list or community, send a short “we’re on Product Hunt today” note with the PH link and ask for support (upvotes + constructive comments).
- [ ] **Team:** If you have co-founders or early users, ask them to upvote and leave the first genuine comments right after the first comment you post.

## 3. Launch day tactics

- **Stay online:** Check Product Hunt every 1–2 hours. Reply to every comment thoughtfully and quickly (within a few hours).
- **Be helpful, not salesy:** Answer feature questions, share shortcuts (e.g. “You can paste a YouTube URL”), and mention the free tier and privacy when relevant.
- **Share the link:** Post the Product Hunt link on X/Twitter, LinkedIn, and any relevant Slack/Discord communities (where the rules allow). Keep the message short: “We launched VideoText on Product Hunt today — [link]. Would mean a lot if you could check it out and share feedback.”
- **Don’t:** Ask for upvotes in a transactional way (“upvote for upvote”) or use paid upvote services — Product Hunt can detect and down-rank this.
- **Monitor:** Watch for questions about pricing, limits, or “how is this different from X?” — have clear, one-paragraph answers ready (e.g. “We don’t store your data; free tier with no signup; all-in-one from transcript to burn-in captions”).

## 4. Post-launch

- **Thank everyone:** After the 24-hour window, post a short “thank you” in the comments and, if you can, on social.
- **Capture feedback:** Note feature requests and pain points from comments; use them for roadmap or a follow-up “What we learned from our Product Hunt launch” post.
- **Follow up:** If someone had an issue (e.g. “didn’t work on mobile”), reach out or reply with a fix or workaround so they feel heard.

## 5. Quick reference: your differentiators

Use these when replying to “What makes VideoText different?”:

| Point | One-liner |
|-------|-----------|
| **All-in-one** | Transcript, SRT/VTT, translate, fix, burn captions, compress, batch — one place. |
| **No signup to try** | Free tier, paste URL or upload, no account required. |
| **Privacy** | We process and delete; we don’t store your files. |
| **Pro features** | Summary, chapters, speaker diarization, multi-language subtitles, batch. |
| **Reliable** | Chunked uploads, retries, works on mobile; we’ve tuned for real-world use. |

Good luck with the launch. If you want, we can tighten any section (e.g. tagline options or first comment) once you’ve drafted your real story.
